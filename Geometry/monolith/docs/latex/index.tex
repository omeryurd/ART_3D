\section{\-Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
\-The \-Monolith \-Framework can be used to create a stereoscopic environment with input from 6\-D\-O\-F devices such as a head or wand tracking device.\section{\-Contents}\label{index_content_sec}
\-This package consists of one main class\-: \-Monolith. \-For new applications, use this class. \-Also provided are secondary classes to perform common functions. \-These include \-Camera and display for setting up the environment, \-Matrix4 and \-Vector3 for math, and \-Head and \-Wand for handling tracking information. \-The current \-Camera, \-Display, \-Head, and \-Wand in use can be retrived using methods in the \-Monolith class. \-All classes of the \-Monolith framework use the \doxyref{\-M\-T\-F}{p.}{namespace_m_t_f} namespace.
