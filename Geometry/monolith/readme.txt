The Monolith Tracking Framework (MTF) was created using Visual Studio 2010.  It may have issues if you try to use it with a lower version of Visual Studio.

MTF relies on the Boost framework (http://www.boost.org/).  The version MTF was created with is 1.46.1.  Using newer versions of Boost should work fine.
